      - title: "Hundred Years' War- Joan of Arc (pictured) was captured by Burgundian forces at the Siege of Compiègne."
        description: "The Hundred Years' War was a conflict between the kingdoms of England and France and a civil war in France during the Late Middle Ages. It emerged from feudal disputes over the Duchy of Aquitaine and was triggered by a claim to the French throne made by Edward III of England. The war grew into a broader military, economic, and political struggle involving factions from across Western Europe, fuelled by emerging nationalism on both sides. The periodisation of the war typically charts it as taking place over 116 years. However, it was an intermittent conflict which was frequently interrupted by external factors, such as the Black Death, and several years of truces."

While serving as papal nuncio in Spain, he developed an anti-Spanish outlook that later coloured his papacy. In response to an invasion of part of the Papal States by Spain during his papacy, he called for a French military intervention. After a defeat of the French and with Spanish troops at the edge of Rome, the Papacy and Spain reached a compromise- French and Spanish forces left the Papal States and the Pope thereafter adopted a neutral stance between France and Spain."

Charles had named as his heir Philip (Bourbon) of Anjou, a grandson of Louis XIV of France, whose claim was backed by France and most of Spain. His rival, Archduke Charles (Habsburg) of Austria, was supported by the Grand Alliance, whose primary members included Austria, the Dutch Republic, and Great Britain.
