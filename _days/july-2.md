At 06-30 local time (MMT) heavy rains triggered the collapse of a heap of mining waste, which came tumbling down into a lake. This generated a 6.1-meter (20 ft) wave of mud and water that buried those working at the Wai Khar mine. The miners killed or injured by the landslide were independent 'jade pickers', who scavenge tailings from larger operators and who live in ramshackle quarters at the base of large mounds of rubble."
