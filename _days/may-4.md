The revolution ultimately culminated in the American Revolutionary War, which began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, on April 19, 1775. The war between the colonies and the Kingdom of Great Britain continued for eight years. Leaders of the American Revolution were colonial separatist leaders who, as British subjects, initially sought incremental levels of autonomy. But later, assembled in present-day Independence Hall in the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia, they embraced and joined the cause of full independence and the Revolutionary War, forming the Continental Army and appointing George Washington as its commander-in-chief in 1775 and unanimously adopting and issuing the Declaration of Independence the following year, which served to inspire, formalize, and escalate the war, which ultimately ended British colonial rule over the colonies, permitting their independence and the establishment of the United States of America."

In addition to the establishment of the gallery, Boydell planned to produce an illustrated edition of William Shakespeare's plays and a folio of prints based upon a series of paintings by different contemporary painters. During the 1790s the London gallery that showed the original paintings emerged as the project's most popular element."
  1886:
    events:
      - title: "During a labor rally in Chicago, a bomb explosion and gunfire led to the deaths of eight police officers and four members of the public."
        description: "The labour movement is the collective organisation of working people to further their shared political and economic interests. It consists of the trade union or labour union movement, as well as political parties of labour. It can be considered an instance of class conflict.In trade unions, workers campaign for higher wages, better working conditions and fair treatment from their employers, and through the implementation of labour laws, from their governments. They do this through collective bargaining, sectoral bargaining, and when needed, strike action. In some countries, co-determination gives representatives of workers seats on the board of directors of their employers.Political parties representing the interests of workers campaign for labour rights, social security and the welfare state. They are usually called a labour party, a social democratic party, a socialist party, or sometimes a workers' party. Though historically less prominent, the cooperative movement campaigns to replace capitalist ownership of the economy with worker cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and other types of cooperative ownership. This is related to the concept of economic democracy."
  1942:

Nearly all of the world's countries participated, with many nations mobilising all resources in pursuit of total war. Tanks and aircraft played major roles, enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70 to 85 million deaths, more than half of which were civilians. Millions died in genocides, including the Holocaust, and by massacres, starvation, and disease. After the Allied victory, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea were occupied, and German and Japanese leaders were tried for war crimes."

It is in the Mansiri Himal, part of the Nepalese Himalayas, in west-central Nepal. Manaslu means 'mountain of the spirit' and the word is derived from the Sanskrit word manasa, meaning 'intellect' or 'soul'. Manaslu was first climbed on May 9, 1956, by Toshio Imanishi and Gyalzen Norbu, members of a Japanese expedition. It is said that, given the many unsuccessful attempts by the British to climb Everest before Nepali Tenzing Norgay and New Zealander Edmund Hillary, 'just as the British consider Everest their mountain, Manaslu has always been a Japanese mountain'."
