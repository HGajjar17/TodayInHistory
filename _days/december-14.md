During the late 1950s and early 1960s, there had been a media frenzy about the perceived prevalence of illegal bowling actions in world cricket. The controversy and speculation that dogged Meckiff in the years preceding his final match caused sections of the cricket community to believe that he had been made a scapegoat by the Australian cricket authorities to prove their intent to stamp out throwing."

Many Māori advocate for tino rangatiratanga as a way to restore Māori control over their lands, resources, and cultural institutions. The very translation of tino rangatiratanga is important to New Zealand politics, as it is used in the Māori version of the Treaty of Waitangi to express 'full exclusive and undisturbed possession' over Māori-owned lands and property, but different translations have drastically different implications for the relationship between the 1840 signatories- the British Crown and the Māori chiefs (rangatira)."
