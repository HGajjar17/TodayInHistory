        description: "The 1764 Woldegk tornado was a powerful tornado that is claimed to be one of the strongest tornadoes ever documented in history, struck the town of Woldegk, Germany on June 29, 1764. Receiving the unique T11 rating on the TORRO scale along with an F5 rating on the Fujita scale and had winds estimated to be at least 480 kilometres per hour (300 mph). The tornado traveled 30 kilometres (19 mi) and reached a maximum width of 900 metres (980 yd). Most of the information known about this tornado came from a detailed 77-paragraph study by German scientist Gottlob Burchard Genzmer, which was published one year after the tornado occurred. The tornado completely destroyed several structures, and several tree branches reportedly thrown into the atmosphere. Many areas were covered with up to 2 centimetres (0.8 in) of ice. The storm which produced the tornado was dry, with almost no rain reported. Large hail, reportedly reaching 15 centimetres (6 in) in diameter covered the ground. The hail caused significant crop and property damage, killed dozens of animals, and injured multiple people in a large stretch around the tornado and to the northwest of the tornado's path."

Since robbery under arms was a common aspect of seaborne trade, until the early 19th century all merchant ships carried arms. A sovereign or delegated authority issued commissions, also referred to as letters of marque, during wartime. The commission empowered the holder to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war. This included attacking foreign vessels and taking them as prizes and taking crews prisoner for exchange. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law, with the proceeds divided by percentage between the privateer's sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew. A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission."

After World War I, as early aviation became an increasingly important part of modern warfare, a philosophical rift developed between more traditional ground-based army personnel and those who felt that aircraft were being underutilized and that air operations were being stifled for political reasons unrelated to their effectiveness. The USAAC was renamed from the earlier United States Army Air Service on 2 July 1926, and was part of the larger United States Army. The Air Corps became the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) on 20 June 1941, giving it greater autonomy from the Army's middle-level command structure. During World War II, although not an administrative echelon, the Air Corps (AC) remained as one of the combat arms of the Army until 1947, when it was legally abolished by legislation establishing the Department of the Air Force."
