      - title: "The Picts defeated the Northumbrians at the Battle of Dun Nechtain, severely weakening the latter's power in northern Great Britain."
        description: "The Picts were a group of peoples in what is now Scotland north of the Firth of Forth, in the Early Middle Ages. Where they lived and details of their culture can be gleaned from early medieval texts and Pictish stones. The name Picti appears in written records as an exonym from the late third century AD. They are assumed to have been descendants of the Caledonii and other northern Iron Age tribes. Their territory is referred to as 'Pictland' by modern historians. Initially made up of several chiefdoms, it came to be dominated by the Pictish kingdom of Fortriu from the seventh century. During this Verturian hegemony, Picti was adopted as an endonym. This lasted around 160 years until the Pictish kingdom merged with that of Dál Riata to form the Kingdom of Alba, ruled by the House of Alpin. The concept of 'Pictish kingship' continued for a few decades until it was abandoned during the reign of Caustantín mac Áeda."

Dürer never saw the actual rhinoceros, which was the first living example seen in Europe since Roman times. Instead the image is based on an anonymous written description and brief sketch of an Indian rhinoceros brought to Lisbon in 1515. Later that year, the King of Portugal, Manuel I, sent the animal as a gift for Pope Leo X, but it died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy. Another live rhinoceros was not seen again in Europe until Abada arrived from India to the court of Sebastian of Portugal in 1577."

His publication of the sonnets has long been controversial. Nineteenth-century critics thought that he might have published the poems without Shakespeare's consent; Sidney Lee called him 'predatory and irresponsible.' Conversely, modern scholars Wells and Taylor assert their verdict that 'Thorpe was a reputable publisher, and there is nothing intrinsically irregular about his publication.'"

The skull was well-preserved, but some bones of the skeleton, particularly many between the skull and the pelvis, were absent. Osteological assessment identified the remains as those of a young female. The presence of raspberry seeds in her stomach contents, coupled with an estimated age of early to mid-twenties at death, led to her being nicknamed Hallonflickan. As of 2015, she represented the earliest known Neolithic individual from Western Sweden, having been radiocarbon-dated 3928–3651 BC. Her estimated height of 145 cm was deemed notably short for a Stone Age woman of the region."
