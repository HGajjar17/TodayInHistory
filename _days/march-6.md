It was founded by a dynasty descended from Muhammad's uncle, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, from whom the dynasty takes its name.

The Mexican Congress passed the Tornel Decree, declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops 'will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag'. Only the province of Texas succeeded in breaking with Mexico, establishing the Republic of Texas. It was eventually annexed by the United States about a decade later."
