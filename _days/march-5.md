    events:
      - title: "Roman–Persian Wars- Roman emperor Julian and his army set out from Antioch to attack the Sasanian Empire."
        description: "The Roman–Persian Wars, also called the Roman–Iranian Wars, took place between the Greco-Roman world and the Iranian world, beginning with the Roman Republic and the Parthian Empire in 54 BC and ending with the Roman Empire and the Sasanian Empire in 628 AD. While the conflict between the two civilizations did involve direct military engagements, a significant role was played by a plethora of vassal kingdoms and allied nomadic nations, which served as buffer states or proxies for either side. Despite nearly seven centuries of hostility, the Roman–Persian Wars had an entirely inconclusive outcome, as both the Byzantines and the Sasanians were attacked by the Rashidun Caliphate as part of the early Muslim conquests, which had begun under Muhammad a few years earlier in the adjacent Arabian Peninsula. The Rashidun offensives resulted in the collapse of the Sasanian Empire and largely confined the Byzantine Empire to Anatolia for the ensuing Arab–Byzantine Wars."

    events:
      - title: "American Revolution- British soldiers fired into a crowd in Boston, killing five people."
        description: "The American Revolution (1765–1783) was an ideological and political movement in the Thirteen Colonies in what was then British America. The revolution ultimately culminated in the American Revolutionary War, which began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, on April 19, 1775. The war between the colonies and the Kingdom of Great Britain continued for eight years. Leaders of the American Revolution were colonial separatist leaders who, as British subjects, initially sought incremental levels of autonomy. But later, assembled in present-day Independence Hall in the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia, they embraced and joined the cause of full independence and the Revolutionary War, forming the Continental Army and appointing George Washington as its commander-in-chief in 1775 and unanimously adopting and issuing the Declaration of Independence the following year, which served to inspire, formalize, and escalate the war, which ultimately ended British colonial rule over the colonies, permitting their independence and the establishment of the United States of America."

The war, which began primarily over the control of what is now Northeastern India, ended in a decisive British victory, giving the British total control of Assam, Manipur, Cachar and Jaintia as well as Arakan Province and Tenasserim. The Burmese submitted to a British demand to pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling, and signed a commercial treaty."

        description: "Roberto Cofresí y Ramírez de Arellano, better known as El Pirata Cofresí, was a pirate from Puerto Rico. He was born into a noble family, but the political and economic difficulties faced by the island as a colony of the Spanish Empire during the regional independence wars against the metropole meant that his household was poor. Cofresí worked at sea from an early age which familiarized him with the region's geography, but it provided only a modest salary, and he eventually decided to abandon the sailor's life and became a pirate. He had previous links to land-based criminal activities, but the reason for Cofresí's change of vocation is unknown; historians speculate that he may have worked as a privateer aboard El Scipión, a ship owned by one of his cousins."

Nearly all of the world's countries participated, with many nations mobilising all resources in pursuit of total war. Tanks and aircraft played major roles, enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70 to 85 million deaths, more than half of which were civilians.
